Objective 
This Assignment is regarding the Bike Sharing Demand Prediction Challenge, where 
your goal is to predict the number of hourly bike rentals, using weather, time, and seasonal 
data. Through this problem, you will:  
• Learn how to analyze a real-world dataset, 
• Apply Linear Regression and its extensions, 
• Understand nonlinearity and regularization, 
• Evaluate models using a logarithmic error metric (RMSLE).

Target column: count (number of bikes rented per hour) 
Evaluation Metric 
You will be graded primarily on RMSLE: 
RMSLE = sqrt( (1/n) * Σ (log(pred+1) - log(actual+1))² ) 
This function is not available in the sklearn library. You can use the below code to compute 
RMLSE: 
def rmsle(y_true, y_pred): 
return np.sqrt(np.mean((np.log1p(y_pred) - np.log1p(y_true))**2)) 
Task Breakdown 
Executing the Assignment on BITS Lab portal – 0.5 Marks 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – 0.5 Marks 
Q1. Examine dataset size, missing values, and feature types. 
Q2. Visualize relationships between key features and the target variable (count). 
Q3. Suggest which variables are likely to be most informative. 
Feature Engineering - (Optional hints to improve performance) 
Q4. You can try to derive features from datetime (hour, weekday, month, season), encode 
categorical variables, consider transformations to capture nonlinear trends to improve 
your model performance. If you do any of these, report it as answer to Q4. It is optional. 
Regression Model - 2 Marks (Based on Leaderboard score/rank) 
Q5. Split data into training and validation sets and build a simple Linear Regression model. 
Q6. To improve model performance, you may try to: 
 Extend feature space using polynomial transformations (degree 2 or 3) 
 Apply Ridge and Lasso regression on polynomial features, Tune the regularization 
strength (α). 
Model Comparison and Interpretation - 2 Marks 
Q7. Summarize all results (of different models tried out) in one table (RMSLE, key 
observations). 
Q8. Plot residuals for the best model. 
Q9. Explain why the winning model performs better. 
Reflection Questions (For your understanding – 0.25 bonus marks for attempting) 
Q10. Why does RMSLE penalize under-predictions more gently than RMSE? 
Q11. What are the trade-offs between model simplicity and predictive power? 
Q12. Why can’t Linear Regression alone capture time-of-day effects effectively?
